# PyFlexe
Flexe is a new framework for simulation of Federated Learning (FL) in Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAVs). Its adaptable design allows for the implementation of a variety of FL schemes, including horizontal, vertical, and Federated Transfer Learning. PyFlexe is free to download and use, built for customization, and allows for the realistic simulation of wireless networking and vehicle dynamics. The project was partitioned into two, one of which is responsible for vehicle-to-vehicle communication (Flexe) and the other for the construction and training of models (PyFlexe).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
PyFlexe requires the following software to be installed 

- OMNeT++ 6
- conan
- grpc
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch

### OMNeT++ 6 installation
Please do follow the instructions from the official [OMNeT documentation](https://doc.omnetpp.org/omnetpp/InstallGuide.pdf)

### Conan installation
Please do follow the instructions from the official [conan documentation](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/installation.html)

### GRPC installation
Please do follow the instructions from the official [grpc documentation](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/quickstart/)

### TensorFlow installation ()
Please do follow the instructions from the official [grpc documentation](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/quickstart/)

### PyTorch installation ()
Please do follow the instructions from the official [grpc documentation](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/quickstart/)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
